<h1>The Best Movies According to Fatemeh.Khojasteh</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie is one of the most correctful movies of all time that makes me feel better about life,happiness and gifts that god who let you have them.
 i just saw that movie when i was in my deppest days of my whole life , just becuase of that i couldn't live without that.<p/>
<h3>Her</h3>
<P>At least i can say that i feel my own love,peace in the main character who called Theodore.
    i just feel that i live him for few years and i even don't know that.
    i think you should see that as your own till undrestand the true Romance could be made from pure hearts!<P/>
 <h3>Five Feet Apart</h3> 
 <P>i think love could be made by distance and happy endings but in fact in real lives we even don't have a ending that would be good, ture love can't make you feel happy or free but also makes you sad and quiet, although love can make you feel brave and careless.
    this is fivr feet apart real short summary.</P>
